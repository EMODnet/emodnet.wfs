```


So far, we've demonstrated using emodnet.wfs to request complete layers.

However, WFS services allows us to be selective with what features are returned from the EMODnet servers. 
For example: using [CQL filters](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html), we can send a query including a filtering clause that will be executed on the server and return only the subset of the information we request. 
This can make queries a lot faster and reduce the need for filtering data after download. 

For example, let's consider the case where we want to include the territorial sea boundaries in a habitat map.  
One way to approach this would be to download the full layer containing all the European maritime boundaries from the human activities service and then filter the `sf` object returned for features representing Territorial Seas. 

A more efficient approach would be to use a filter and request only the features representing Territorial Seas from the server. 
Let's have a look at how to do that.

### CQL & ECQL Query languages.

CQL (Common Query Language) is a plain-text language created for the OGC Catalog specification. 
GeoServer has adapted it to be an easy-to-use filtering mechanism. GeoServer actually implements a more powerful extension called ECQL (Extended CQL), 
which allows expressing the full range of filters that OGC Filter 1.1 can encode. 
ECQL is accepted in many places in GeoServer.

GeoServer supports the use of both CQL and ECQL in WFS requests and whenever the documentation refers to CQL, ECQL syntax can be used as well.

The examples provided here are only a small subset of filtering functionality available through Geoserver. Full references and further examples can be found in the following documentation:

- [ECQL Reference](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/filter/ecql_reference.html): reference for the syntax of the ECQL language.

- [Filter Function Reference](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html): The OGC Filter Encoding specification provides a generic concept of a filter function. A filter function is a named function with any number of arguments, which can be used in a filter expression to perform specific calculations. This provides much richer expressiveness for defining filters.GeoServer provides many different kinds of filter functions, covering a wide range of functionality including mathematics, string formatting, and geometric operations.

- [CQL and ECQL Tutorial](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html) shows examples of defining filters.

### Initialise EMODnet WFS client

First, let's load the library and start a new WFS client with `emodnet_init_wfs_client`.

```{r setup}
library(emodnet.wfs)
```


```{r}
wfs <- emodnet_init_wfs_client(service = "biology")
```



### Inspecting attributes

To develop filters, we first need information about the attributes we can filter on. 
For example, we might want to know the data type and range or distribution of values of each attributes of a given layer. 

Let's look at existing layers.

```{r}
emodnet_get_wfs_info(wfs)
```

#### Layer attribute names

To start, you might want to know the names of a layer's attributes.

```{r}
layer_attributes_get_names(wfs, layer = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt")
```

All functions can also be used by providing a service name instead of a `wfs` object.

```{r}
layer_attributes_get_names(service = "biology", layer = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt")
```

#### Layer attribute descriptions

The type of filtering you might want to apply will depend on the data type of each attribute. 

You can inspect attribute descriptions (metadata) for a given layer with `layer_attribute_descriptions()`. 

```{r}
layer_attribute_descriptions(wfs, layer = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt")
```

#### Layer attribute summaries

You can get summaries of the values of each attribute with `layer_attributes_summarise()`. This function basically runs `summary()` on the attribute columns of the layer. 

```{r}
layer_attributes_summarise(wfs, layer = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt")
```

#### Inspecting individual layer attributes

You can also inspect individual attributes which, in the case of categorical variables, can give more detailed information on the names and distribution of categories.


```{r}
layer_attribute_inspect(
  wfs,
  layer = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt",
  attribute = "country"
)
```


### Layer attributes table

Finally, to enable full inspection and custom processing of attribute data, you can download the full set of attributes as a `data.frame`, excluding the geometry column. As the geometries are usually the largest column, this is much faster than downloading the full layer and can be useful in developing attribute filtering rules.  

```{r}
attr_tbl <- layer_attributes_tbl(wfs, layer = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt")

attr_tbl
```


## Filtering by attributes

### Filtering categorical attributes values using text comparisons

Once we know the values of a categorical attribute of a layer, we can use them to filter the features returned from our query. 
For example, let's say we are only interested in results for France. 
From our previous interrogation of the attributes associated with the `mediseh_zostera_m_pnt` layer, we have seen that the attribute `country` contains the country. 

We can use the **name of the attribute** and the **value** we require to **construct our eqcl filter** and pass it to our request using the `cql_filter` argument.

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt",
  cql_filter = "country = 'Francia'"
)
```

The above shows the most basic text comparisons we can make use the equality operator `=`. 
If we want to  match more than one value, we can use the operator `IN` instead and provide a list of values to compare to. 
For example, to request both France and Spain, we could use the following filter: 

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt",
  cql_filter = "country IN ('Francia', 'Spagna')"
)
```

It is the same as using the `OR` filter:

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt",
  cql_filter = "country='Francia' OR country='Spagna'"
)
```

Other text comparisons include text pattern matching using operator `LIKE`. For example, to request maritime boundaries for countries starting with an `S`, we can use the following filter: 



```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt",
  cql_filter = "country LIKE 'S%'",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```

CQL/ECQL filters can also include any of the [filter functions](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html#filter-function-reference) available in GeoServer, including multiple [string functions](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html#string-functions) which greatly increases the power of CQL expressions. 

For example, we can request countries that contain `l` anywhere, including the first letter. To make the request case independent, we can turn `country` names to lowercase and then use a `like` comparison to a lowercase `l`:


```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_zostera_m_pnt",
  cql_filter = "strToLowerCase(country) LIKE '%l%'",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">

#### For more details on string functions, consult the [full list](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html#string-functions) in the geoserver function reference user documentation.**

</div>

### Filtering numeric variables

A number of additional **comparison operators, such as =, `<>`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`** , arithmetic operators **`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`** as well as **[comparison](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html#comparison-functions) and [math](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/filter/function_reference.html#comparison-functions) functions** can be used for filtering numeric variables.

This time we'll use the **mediseh_posidonia_nodata**.

We can inspect again, using some of our interrogative functions to get information on layer attributes. 

```{r}
layer_attributes_get_names(
  wfs,
  layer = "mediseh_posidonia_nodata"
)

layer_attribute_inspect(
  wfs,
  layer = "mediseh_posidonia_nodata",
  attribute = "km"
)
```

We can see that values range between `0.23` and `~473` with a mean of `~40`. 

Let's say we are interested in values greater than `400`. We can use the operator `>` to create our filter:

```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_posidonia_nodata",
  cql_filter = "km > 400",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```

To request a range we can use filter functions `between` and `and`.
```{r}
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "mediseh_posidonia_nodata",
  cql_filter = "km between 40 and 400",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```



### Using `OR` and `AND` statements

Filter conditions can also be a logical combination of other conditions using `AND`, `OR` or `NOT`. We showed previously how we could use a list of potential values to match an attribute to. This could also be achieved using an `OR` statement.

For example, the following query returns features where country is either `Baltic Sea` or `Bulgaria`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
wfs <- emodnet_init_wfs_client(service = "geology_seabed_substrate_maps")
emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "seabed_substrate_1m",
  cql_filter = "country='Baltic Sea' OR country='Bulgaria'",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```


Let's say we also want to restrict the features returned those having `shape_length` > 1. We can include an additional condition which must be met using an `AND` statement.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter_sf1 <- emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "seabed_substrate_1m",
  cql_filter = "country='Baltic Sea' OR country='Bulgaria' AND shape_length>1",
  simplify = TRUE
)
filter_sf1
```

The query returns features where `country` is `Baltic Sea` or `Bulgaria` but we can see that the minimum value is below the minimum we set with our filter. That's because the `AND` filter is added only to the `country='Bulgaria'`, so while only features with `shape_length > 1` are returned where `country` is also `Bulgaria`, the filter is not applied to `shape_length` where `country` is `Baltic Sea`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
unique(filter_sf1$country)

min(filter_sf1$shape_length)
```


To add the `AND` filter to both `OR` filters, we can use a parenthesis:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter_sf2 <- emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "seabed_substrate_1m",
  cql_filter = "(country='Baltic Sea' OR country='Bulgaria') AND shape_length>1",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```


Now the minimum value is indeed above 1. However, we only get features where `country` is `'Bulgaria'`. That's because the single `Baltic Sea` feature had a `shape_length` value smaller than 1 so is filtered out.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
min(filter_sf2$shape_length)
unique(filter_sf2$country)
```

Finally filtering for `shape_length < 1` returns features with `shape_length` values smaller than 1 for both `country` values.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
filter_sf3 <- emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = wfs,
  layers = "seabed_substrate_1m",
  cql_filter = "(country='Baltic Sea' OR country='Bulgaria') AND shape_length<1",
  simplify = TRUE
)
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
max(filter_sf3$shape_length)
unique(filter_sf3$country)
```

### Advanced use

There is more that can be accomplished by using the EMODnet WFS services than downloading data. The `emodnet.wfs` package is built on top of the [ows4R](https://github.com/eblondel/ows4R) library, meaning that all the functionalities of this package are available for emodnet.wfs. The ows4R returns a special type of R object called R6. You can learn more in Hadley Wickham's chapter on R6 Objects of the [Advance R book](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/r6.html).

For instance: it is not efficient to read a large dataset into R just and later subset part of it. This requires longer waiting times and more bandwidth usage, and in very large datasets it would simply not be possible. For instance, all the occurrences data available through the EMODnet Biology portal are stored in [one table](https://www.emodnet-biology.eu/emodnet-data-format): These are approximately 30 millions rows! In this case, we suggest you access the EMODnet Biology occurrence data through the [EMODnet geoviewer](https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/geoviewer/?layers=6d617269-6e65-696e-666f-000000001510:1:1&basemap=ebwbl&active=12639&bounds=-177.7018404006958,-87.83122047893704,204.7018404006958,100.83122047893704&filters=&projection=EPSG:3857) or the [eurobis R package](https://github.com/lifewatch/eurobis/). This package retrieves occurrences in batches, allowing for large datasets, and uses `viewParams`, a [geoserver-specific filtering feature](https://docs.geoserver.org/main/en/user/data/database/sqlview.html) for faster requests compared to standard OGC or CQL filters. In addition, one of these specific filters allow to query on species traits such as functional groups.
