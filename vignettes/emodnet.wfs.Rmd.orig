## Introduction

The package was designed to make EMODnet vector data layers easily accessible in R. The package allows users to query information on and download data from all available [EMODnet Web Feature Service (WFS) endpoints](https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/geonetwork/emodnet/eng/catalog.search#/home) directly into their R working environment. Data are managed as [`sf` objects](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) which are currently the state-of-the-art in handling of vector spatial data in R. The package also allows user to specify the coordinate reference system of imported data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of emodnet.wfs from GitHub with:

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
pak::pak("EMODnet/emodnet.wfs")
```

## Explore the EMODnet WFS services with R

For this tutorial we will make use of the `sf`,  `dplyr`  and `mapview` packages. The simple features `sf` package is a well known standard for dealing with geospatial vector data. The package `dplyr` is a strong library for data manipulation. This package also loads `magrittr`'s pipe operator `%>%` (you could also use the [base pipe](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-style.html#sec-pipes)), which allows to write pipelines in R. To visualize geometries,  `mapview` will create quick interactive maps.

Run this line to install these packages:

```{r install.packages, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(c("sf", "dplyr", "mapview"))
```



With the emodnet.wfs package, we can explore and combine the data served by the [EMODnet lots ](https://emodnet.ec.europa.eu/en/emodnet-themes) through [OGC Web Feature Services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Feature_Service) or WFS.

Imagine we are interested in seabed substrates. The first step is to choose what EMODnet lot can provide with these data. For that, we can check the services available with the `emodnet_wfs()` function.

```{r error = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(emodnet.wfs)
library(mapview)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)

emodnet_wfs()
```



The column `service_name` shows services available, while  `service_url` has the corresponding base url to perform a WFS request. The Seabed portal should have the data we are looking for. A WFS client can be created by passing the corresponding `service_name` to the function `emodnet_init_wfs_client()`. The layers available to this WFS client are consulted with `emodnet_get_wfs_info()`.

```{r}
seabed_wfs_client <- emodnet_init_wfs_client(service = "seabed_habitats_general_datasets_and_products")

emodnet_get_wfs_info(wfs = seabed_wfs_client)
```



Each layer is explained in the `abstract` column. We can see several layers with the information provided by the EU member states for the [Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC reporting](https://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/article-17-database-habitats-directive-92-43-eec-2). We will select the layers about coastal lagoons, mudflats and sandbanks with their respective `layer_name`.

```{r}
habitats_directive_layer_names <- c("art17_hab_1110", "art17_hab_1140", "art17_hab_1150")

emodnet_get_layer_info(
  wfs = seabed_wfs_client,
  layers = habitats_directive_layer_names
)
```



We are now ready to read the layers into R with `emodnet_get_layers()`. emodnet.wfs reads the geometries as simple features (See `sf` package) transformed to [4326](https://epsg.io/4326) by default. Specifying another map projection is possible by passing a EPGS code or projection string with `emodnet_get_layers(crs = "your projection")` where crs is a coordinate reference system (CRS). The argument `reduce_layers = TRUE` stack all the layers in one single tibble. Default is FALSE and returns a list of sf objects, one per layer.

```{r}
habitats_directive_layers <- emodnet_get_layers(
  wfs = seabed_wfs_client,
  layers = habitats_directive_layer_names,
  reduce_layers = TRUE
)

class(habitats_directive_layers)

glimpse(habitats_directive_layers)
```



Run the following code to have a quick look at the layers geometries
```{r, eval = TRUE}
# Transform to Polygon geometry type from Multisurface
if (unique(st_geometry_type(habitats_directive_layers)) == "MULTISURFACE") {
  habitats_directive_layers <- habitats_directive_layers %>%
    st_cast(to = "GEOMETRYCOLLECTION") %>%
    st_collection_extract(type = "POLYGON")
}

# Visualize
map <- mapview(habitats_directive_layers, zcol = "habitat_description", burst = TRUE)

map
```

EMODnet provides also physics, chemistry, biological or bathymetry data. Explore all the layers available with.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
emodnet_get_all_wfs_info()
```
